    The goal: Let everyone play with many different TypeScript features
    and get an overview of TypeScript capabilities and principles.

    Things to cover:

        1. Basic typing.
        2. Refining types.
        3. Union types.
        4. Merged types.
        5. Generics.
        6. Type declarations.
        7. Module augmentation.
        8. Advanced type mapping.

    Rules and principles:

        1. Avoid using "any" type at all costs.
        2. Difficulty quickly grows one exercise after another.
        3. Feel free to send pull-requests if you've come up
           with improvements!
        4. Provide feedback to the creator of these exercises.
        5. Enjoy.

Intro:

    We are starting a small community of users. For performance
    reasons we have decided to store all users right in the code.
    This way we can provide our developers with more
    user-interaction opportunities. With user-related data, at least.
    All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.
    This would be the base for our future experiments during
    these exercises.

Exercise:

    Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.

*/

export type User = {
        name: string,
        age: number,
        occupation: string
};

export const users: User[] = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: User) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

console.log('Users:');
users.forEach(user => logPerson(user));

# Typescript union types
```typescript
/*

Intro:

    All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go
    forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.
    Let's add a couple of admins.

    Initially we only had users in the in-memory database. After
    introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that
    everything works well together.

Exercise:

    Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use
    it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix
    all the TS errors.

*/

interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    occupation: string;
}

interface Admin {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    role: string;
}

export type Person = User | Admin;

export const persons: Person[] /* <- Person[] */ = [
    {
        name: 'Max Mustermann',
        age: 25,
        occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
    },
    {
        name: 'Jane Doe',
        age: 32,
        role: 'Administrator'
    },
    {
        name: 'Kate Müller',
        age: 23,
        occupation: 'Astronaut'
    },
    {
        name: 'Bruce Willis',
        age: 64,
        role: 'World saver'
    }
];

export function logPerson(user: Person) {
    console.log(` - ${user.name}, ${user.age}`);
}

persons.forEach( user => logPerson(user) );
