1. Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?
```
Java is compiled
```
2. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
```
BEGIN    
    I need to get the value in Quetzales from User.
    I need to get the information about the equivalance 1 USD in Quetzales.
    I need to divide the value in Quetzales / Equivalance in Dolars.
    I need to show the result in Dollars
END
```

3. Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?
```
It's helpful because we can see the steps that we need to do before resolving the problem using programming languages, and we don't need strict rules when we use pseudocode
```

4. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)
```
BEGIN
    var_today = 2022
    var_date_born = What is your birth date?
    var_age = var_today - var_date_born
    Your age is : var_age
END
```
5. Whyy are flowcharts important to us as developers?
```
The flowcharts give us another perspective about our process in a System, and is easier to understand for every people in a team, the flowchart give us when start a process and when finish a process, what happend when we follow the flow
```
6. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with this video
```
High-level => Java, JavaScript, GO, PHP,... in every programming language, you have instructions that you can understand at some point, and with that instruction, you can build a program with that specific instructions, but after the computer run the instructions you need a compiler to transform that instruction into another that it's easier to understand for computers or an interpreter to read every instruction and the computer can understand

Low-level => in this case you have instruction with less comprehension because you have only three instructions for every step and most of the time if you want to add up is not easier to create that instructions. you need more steps to complete a sum.
