          >cybersecurity</a
        >. One method of keeping data secure is the use of encryption. This
        involves turning readable information into unreadable information that
        can only be accessed with an encryption key.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in cryptography, you'll need to learn at least one
        (and typically more than one) programming language. Here are the best
        languages for cryptography.
      </p>
      <h2 id="1-python">1. Python</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >Python</a
        >
        is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It's a
        general-purpose language, which means it's used for a wide range of
        tasks, including cryptography. It's also beginner-friendly, so it's an
        excellent place to start if you're new to coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is open source, which means it's free to use, and it has a large
        and active community. It also has an extensive selection of libraries
        and frameworks, which means you have a wealth of resources at your
        disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is also a popular language for cryptography. One of its libraries
        is called "cryptography," and it has secure primitives. A primitive is
        the smallest, simplest data type.
      </p>
      <p>
        One popular secure primitive is the Fernet implementation, which
        supports "secret key" cryptography. This type of encryption uses the
        same key to encrypt and decrypt information.
      </p>
      <h2 id="2-go">2. Go</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/go?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >Go</a
        >, also known as Golang, is a programming language that was created by
        Google. It's an open-source language designed to be simple and easy to
        learn. It's also designed to perform well at scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go is a popular choice for cryptography because several packages have
        been designed for Go that support cryptographic operations.
      </p>
      <h2 id="3-ruby">3. Ruby</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/ruby?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >Ruby</a
        >
        is another popular, general-purpose programming language. It was
        released in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto, who said he was "trying to make
        Ruby natural, not simple."
      </p>
      <p>
        A significant amount of Ruby's growth and popularity is due to the
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-ruby-on-rails/?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >Ruby on Rails</a
        >
        framework. Like Python and Go, Ruby is open source. OpenSSL is a popular
        Ruby library that's used for cryptography.
      </p>
      <h2 id="4-c-">4. C++</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/c-plus-plus?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >C++</a
        >
        was designed to improve the
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >C programming language</a
        >, and it's now found just about everywhere, including operating
        systems, video games, and web browsers. It gives programmers a high
        level of control over system memory and resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        One reason for its popularity for cryptography is Crypto++, which is a
        C++ library of cryptographic algorithms. The library was first released
        in 1995 and supports a wide range of operating systems, including
        Android, macOS, iOS, Linux, and Windows.
      </p>
      <h2 id="5-c-">5. C#</h2>
      <p>
        Like C++,
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/c-sharp?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >C#</a
        >
        has its roots in the C family of programming languages. It's a
        general-purpose language developed by Microsoft, is relatively easy to
        learn, and has a speedy compilation and execution time.
      </p>
      <p>
        C# programs run on the .NET framework, which is a virtual execution
        system. This program provides a set of cryptographic objects for common
        uses, including encryption and generating digital signatures.
      </p>
      <h2 id="6-java">6. Java</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >Java</a
        >
        is a very popular programming language favored by developers for its
        versatility and portability. You can quickly move code written in Java
        from a laptop to a mobile device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has a cryptography

          href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/what-is-an-api?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >API</a
        >
        that's provided by the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE). An API
        (application programming interface) is a software intermediary that
        helps applications talk to each other. JCE allows you to scramble and
        unscramble data, verify data sent by others, annotate code, and perform
        administrative operations associated with cryptographic primitives.
      </p>
      <h2 id="7-php">7. PHP</h2>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/php?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >PHP</a
        >
        is a server-side programming language that works well with
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >HTML</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/what-is-a-database?utm_source=ccblog&amp;utm_medium=ccblog&amp;utm_campaign=ccblog&amp;utm_content=cw_best_programming_languages_cryptography_blog"
          >databases</a
        >. Like most other programming languages, it's open source. PHP code is
        executed on a server, and the result is returned to the browser as HTML.
        PHP can do a wide variety of tasks, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files on a server
        </li>
        <li>Adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database</li>
        <li>Sending and receiving cookies</li>
        <li>Controlling user access</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        PHP can also encrypt data, and it has several useful functions that
        simplify hashing. <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/">Sodium</a>, an
        easy-to-use PHP library, also simplifies secret key encryption.
